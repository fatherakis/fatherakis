# 👋 Hi

I’m ``` @fatherakis#7858 ```

👀 I’m interested in ...
    ```Bot ideas for any supported platform eg. Discord, Twitter, Github etc.```
    ```Arduino Projects (They do seem interesting and fun to program)```
    ```Raspberry Pi projects learning any potential uses for it and trying to make them possible```

🌱 I’m currently learning ... 
    *How wondreful the world of electronics wouldn't be if there were no assignments in it.*
    *Improving my knowledge in programming and hardware languages.* 

Mostly focused on C, Python, Javascript  and VHDL.

Lets play a game: Guess which is the hardware language from the above.

 <!--💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... a trip to *S-**pain***-->
